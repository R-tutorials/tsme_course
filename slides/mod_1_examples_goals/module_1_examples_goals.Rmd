## Learning outcomes

In this lecture we will:  

- Learn some key time series concepts and features
- Get to see some of the example timeseries that we'll use on the course
- Understand the types of analysis that we want to do, and why
- Learn to avoid some common mistakes

## What is a time series?

- A collection of data indexed by (strictly increasing) time
- Can be regular or irregular
- Usually one value per time

__“With one dimension marching along to the regular rhythm of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, centuries, or millennia, the natural ordering of the time scale gives this design a strength and efficiency of interpretation found in no other graphic arrangement.”__

Edward R. Tufte

## Time Series Analysis: What's the point?

What do we use time series methods for? Often, we are trying to do at least one of the following:

1. Description: what is going on?
2. Understanding: how is it going on, and why?
3. Prediction: What is going to go on next?

## First, description
- HadCRUT4 Annual globally averaged surface temperature, from the Met Office Hadley Centre and Climate Research Unit, UEA.

- How do we separate the **structure** (here the long term trend) and the random **noise**?
```{r plot hadcrut straight, echo=FALSE}
hadcrut = read.csv('~/GitHub/tsme_course/data/hadcrut.csv')
with(hadcrut,plot(Year,Anomaly))
# Is there a trend? (this could just be a slice from a random process, right?)
# If yes, why is there a trend
# In that case, what will happen next year? How about in 2100?
```

## Plot the data
- Using a line plot gives a slightly different impression.
```{r plot hadcrut l, echo=FALSE}
hadcrut = read.csv('~/GitHub/tsme_course/data/hadcrut.csv')
with(hadcrut,plot(Year,Anomaly,type='l'))
# perhaps plot a smoothed version?
```

## What is going on?
We get a different impression again if we just plot the last 15 years ...

## What is going on?

So, what *is* structure?   

And what is random?  

And, **how** does that randomness manifest?


## A simpler example? Sea level rise
- Church and White
- There appears relatively less noise in this data compared to the trend
```{r load sea level data, echo=FALSE}
candw = read.csv('~/GitHub/tsme_course/data/church_and_white_global_tide_gauge.csv')
with(candw,plot(year_AD,sea_level_m,type='l'))
```

## How do we go about it?
We know there is **randomness** and **uncertainty** in the timeseries. We can use a **statistical** model to help us understand and predict the system. This usually proceeds:

1. Model identification and selection
2. Parameter estimation
3. Model checking

There are a number of **features** of time series and **concepts** that help in the process ...

## Periodicity and cycles
- Time series may show **periodicity** and **cycles** - often seasonal, but perhaps with more complexity.

```{r plot ldeaths, echo=TRUE}
plot(ldeaths)
```

## Changes in variability & Heteroskedasticity
- This AirPassengers data set shows **heteroskedasticity** - changes in variability.
```{r plot AirPassengers, echo=TRUE}
plot(AirPassengers)
```

## Example - GISP2 stable isotope ratios in Greenland ice
- This data shows **heteroskedacity** and **regime changes** and a lot of **structure**
```{r load gisp2 data, echo=FALSE}
gisp2 = read.table('~/GitHub/tsme_course/data/gispd18o_raw.txt', na.strings = '999999')
colnames(gisp2) = c('Depth','d18o','Age')
with(gisp2,plot(Age,d18o,type='l'))
```

## Changes in variability & Heteroskedascticity
- Monthly NH sea ice Anomaly from 1978 to present.
- Monthly Central England Temperature (CET) from 1659 

## Autocorrelation and memory
- **Autocorrelation** is the correlation of a random process **with itself** at a different time.
- some created examples here

## Smoothing
- When we smooth a timeseries, we are applying a filter to try and remove some of the randomness, and get at (or remove) the underlying structure.
- We are making assumptions, and imposing structure. You have to put something in in order to get something out.

## Stationarity
- In a **stationary** timeseries **mean**, **variance** and **autocorrelation** structure do not change over time.
- Stationarity is a common assumption in some types of time series analysis.
 
## Differencing
- A timeseries of the differences between the values.
- Differencing can be used used to make a non-stationary trend stationary.
- First differencing removes a linear trend, $k$th-order differencing removes a polynomial trend of order $k$
```{r, echo = FALSE}
with(hadcrut, plot(diff(Anomaly), type = 'l'))
```

# The limits of our analysis

## The Lynx data

This is the ```lynx``` data set, annual numbers of lynx trappings for Canada 1821 - 1934. Regarded as representative of the population.
```{r plot lynx, echo=TRUE}
plot(lynx)
```

## The Lynx data

- Reilly and Zeringue (2004) use a simple dynamic predator-prey model, trained on the first 80 years of data, to predict the last 34.
- The simple model outperforms many of the best time series methods.

- RMS error of 1480, compared to 1600 for SETAR method fit with entire data set.
